welcome to the workshop source repo
in here currently is source code for my projects and anyone else that wants to upload their's

bare in mind this very much a W.I.P but will also probably always stay a work in progress

Usage instructions

fork the repo

clone the fork

add your character files to specific part of the repo (preferbly the fraytools files)

and submit a pull request

if its still confusing use google till i can write a better tutorial


don't want to mess with github? no problem, message BoneManSeth#5582 on discord or ping me with the files to add to the repo and i'll add it as soon as i can
