Name: Cubey the Speedy Punisher

Description: this was an This was an experiment to see how fast I can make a decently competent character with currently available tools

there were struggles:
Doing vfx was very difficult and easily took 5 hours by itself, most of if it is because there's no preview for vfx animations so I had to go by their description which didn't always align with what actually played (like seriously some of them are named "DUST" + something). also doesn't help that aligning vfx is pain and a half since it just takes forever to find the right spot

Sound effects were also an issue for the same things as most attack sounds were confusingly named and do not have descriptions explaining basic usage, that and the fact that there are hit sounds in there as well which definitely got confusing.

the neutral special, I'm not going to in depth check the code for yourself it's a mess, mostly because I needed a projectile that can be continuously hit to knock it around, so it's basically a hacky nightmare

positioning sprites in fraytools was also a pain, would be nice if I could apply a position offset to all keyframes at once instead of setting 1 and then copying it to each and every keyframe

hilariously the easiest and quickest part was animating the character, aside from purposefully making a simple design (literally took 5 minutes to come up with the design and complete sprite), most of the animations were already done in the first 10 hours
