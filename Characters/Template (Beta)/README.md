patch notes:

0.77 - documentation update

hitboxstats and animationstats have their part done
its a great reminder that you should never be writing things while tired, as good lord its a mess
also new portrait

0.76 - the ledge jump update

ledge jumps work now without a silly workaround

0.75 - movement changes, hacky ledge jump, and grabs:

until ledge jumps are figured out, i made a hacky workaround

dash dancing actually works, instead of the glitchy thing from the previous version

grabs are implemented, they're not balanced or make any sense but they're there
