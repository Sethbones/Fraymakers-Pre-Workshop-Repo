patch notes:

0.79.9 resprite prerelease

i'm tired so actual 0.8 release tommorow hopefully

full resprite half finished, still gotta do jab animations

minor code cleanup (although still a lot more)

intro animation working

gold alt with sparkels

functioning forward strong

crash animations

worse folder layout for the sprites because i'm tired

more animations moved to the legacy tab as they only exist state wise

i probably missed some things cause i did a lot


0.77 - documentation update

hitboxstats and animationstats have their part done
its a great reminder that you should never be writing things while tired, as good lord its a mess
also new portrait


0.76 - the ledge jump update

ledge jumps work now without a silly workaround


0.75 - movement changes, hacky ledge jump, and grabs:

until ledge jumps are figured out, i made a hacky workaround

dash dancing actually works, instead of the glitchy thing from the previous version

grabs are implemented, they're not balanced or make any sense but they're there
