patch notes:

0.9 final pre-character template

general code cleanup

minor balance changes (it's now cracked, but not nearly as cracked as before)

resprite has been fully finished and animations have been touched up a bit more

all movement animations frame timings now match with commander video

hud expressions now work as they should

the final block is vfx for which i will not do, everything here took long enough to manually document as is

this is the final update the character will get till the official character template is out.
i made it my goal to make a fully functional character before the official template is out, i succeeded, and i can now rest.

and note to any aspiring game developer who plans on making a game based around creation:
do not launch the game in any game in capacity if the main hook is not ready yet, this game should've launched with character creation as a minimum, but it didn't.

i applaud the community for all the work they have done to kick off fraymakers custom content and lay the groundwork for when the game comes out to early access.
this project would not have been possible had the community not have grown as quickly as it did.

So basically, I'm on break now, see ya again when the official character template is out 

0.79.9 resprite prerelease

i'm tired so actual 0.8 release tommorow hopefully

full resprite half finished, still gotta do jab animations

minor code cleanup (although still a lot more)

intro animation working

gold alt with sparkels

functioning forward strong

crash animations

worse folder layout for the sprites because i'm tired

more animations moved to the legacy tab as they only exist state wise

i probably missed some things cause i did a lot


0.77 - documentation update

hitboxstats and animationstats have their part done
its a great reminder that you should never be writing things while tired, as good lord its a mess
also new portrait


0.76 - the ledge jump update

ledge jumps work now without a silly workaround


0.75 - movement changes, hacky ledge jump, and grabs:

until ledge jumps are figured out, i made a hacky workaround

dash dancing actually works, instead of the glitchy thing from the previous version

grabs are implemented, they're not balanced or make any sense but they're there
